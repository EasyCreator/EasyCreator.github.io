title: Templates are gone
---

I have decided to strip out all the EasyCreator extension templates into a special repository.

1) First reason is the amount of maintenance required.
1) Second is the fact that I believe that all developers are capable of understanding the english terms used in EasyCreator `=;D`
1) I'm not quite sure how to integrate a composer package into a Joomla! CMS component, and I am not willing to use ini files...
1) We should gain some speed `=;)`

In any case the language files have been moved to this repo: [EasyCreator/g11n](https://github.com/EasyCreator/g11n)

Thanks to everybody involved!
