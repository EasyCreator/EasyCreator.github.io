title: Templates are gone

I have decided to strip out all the EasyCreator extension templates into a special repository.

I hope this will make the extension creation more easier. It should also improve the development of new templates ;)

Extensions will be packed into packages that can be installed from within EasyCreator.

The repository can be found here: https://github.com/EasyCreator/templates

This feature will be available with version 0.0.26
