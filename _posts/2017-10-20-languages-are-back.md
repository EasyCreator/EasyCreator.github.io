I think there was too many time invested into making EasyCreator multilanguage, including a custom language handler that was created for EasyCreator...

So I decided to include a version of g11n into EasyCreator, instead of maintaining a separate library.

All translation files and templates have been updated too.

Feel free to contribute your translations on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/opentranslators/easycreator/dashboard/)
